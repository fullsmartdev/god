== 0.4.0 / 2007-09-13

* Major Enhancements
  * Add the ability for conditions to override transition state (for exceptional cases)
  * Implement dynamic load of config files while god is running (god load <filename>)
  * Add ability to save auto-daemonized process output to a log file
  * Add robust default stop lambda command for auto-daemonized processes (inspired by _eric)
  * Add status command for god binary (shows status of each watch)
  * Create proper logger with timestamps
  * Add log command to god binary to get real time logs for a specific watch from a running god instance
  * Add terminate command for god binary (stop god and all watches)
* Minor Enhancements
  * Enforce validity of Watches
  * Enforce that God.init is not called after a Watch
  * Move pid_file_directory creation and validation to God.start
  * Remove check for at least one Watch during startup (now that dynamic loading exists)
* New Conditions
  * Tries < PollCondition - triggers after the specified number of tries
  * Add :notify_when_flapping behavior to check for oscillation [kevinclark]
  * Add :degrading_lambda condition. [kevinclark]
    It uses a decaying interval (1/2 rate) for 3 cycles before failing.
* Bug Fixes
  * Use exit!(0) instead of exit! in god binary to exit with code 0 (instead of default -1)
  * Command line group control fixed
  * Fix cross-thread return problem (use exit instead)

* Add uid/gid setting for processes [kevinclark]
* Add autostart flag for watches so they don't necessarily startup with god [kevinclark]
* Change command line call options for god binary to accommodate watch start/stop functionality
* Add individual start/stop/restart grace periods for finer grained control
* Change default DRb port to 17165 ('god'.to_i(32))
* Implement command line control to start/restart/stop/monitor/unmonitor watches/groups by name
* Watches can now belong to a group that can be controlled as a whole
* Allow god to be installed (sans events) on systems that don't support events
* Daemonize and handle PID files for non-daemonizing scripts [kevinclark]
* Fix simple mode lifecycle gap
* Remove necessity to specify pid_file for conditions
* Change config file to use God.init and God.watch directly instead of God.meddle block
* Move god binary command logic to main library
* Enhance god binary with better reporting
* Fix synchronization bug in Timer (reported by Srini Panguluri)
* Add Lambda condition for easy custom conditions [Mike Mintz]
* Add sugar for numerics (seconds, minutes, kilobytes, megabytes, percent, etc)
* Add optional PID and log file generation to god binary for daemon mode
* Add God.load to do glob enabled loading
* Add -V option to god binary for detailed version/build info

== 0.2.0 / 2007-07-18

* Rewrote innards to use a state and event based lifecycle
* Basic support for events via kqueue (bsd/darwin) and netlink/pec (linux) [kevinclark]
* Added advanced syntax (simple syntax calls advanced api underneath)
* Condition returns have changed meaning. With simple syntax, a true return activates block
