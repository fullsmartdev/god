Subject: [ANN] god 0.2.0 released

A lot of work has gone into god since the last release. Say goodbye to polling for process status--support for event based conditions via kqueue/netlink has been added (thanks Kevin Clark)! Only a few events are currently supported (most prominently process exit), but the way is now open for the addition of other events. A new, advanced syntax is available (in addition to the familiar simple syntax) that gives you full power over the new state based lifecycle of your Watches. Updated documentation is available on the website:

  http://god.rubyforge.org/


WHAT IS GOD?

God is an easy to configure, easy to extend monitoring framework written in Ruby.

Keeping your server processes and tasks running should be a simple part of your deployment process. God aims to be the simplest, most powerful monitoring application available.


DISCLAIMER

God is still very young, I'd love to get feedback and bug reports, but I do not yet recommend you use it for mission critical tasks. I personally use it in production but then I'm a daring fellow.


INSTALL

sudo gem install god

* note: currently tested only on Redhat Linux and Darwin (won't work on Windows)


FEATURES

* Config file is written in Ruby
* Easily write your own custom conditions in Ruby
* Supports both poll and event based conditions
* Different poll conditions can have different intervals


EXAMPLE

The easiest way to understand how god will make your life better is by looking at a sample config file. The following configuration file is what I use at gravatar.com to keep the mongrels running:

# file:      gravatar.god
# run with:  god start -c /path/to/gravatar.god
# 
# This is the actual config file used to keep the mongrels of
# gravatar.com running.

RAILS_ROOT = "/var/www/gravatar2/current"

God.meddle do |god|
  %w{8200 8201 8202}.each do |port|
    god.watch do |w|
      w.name = "gravatar2-mongrel-#{port}"
      w.interval = 30 # seconds default
      w.start = "mongrel_rails cluster::start --only #{port} \
        -C #{RAILS_ROOT}/config/mongrel_cluster.yml"
      w.stop = "mongrel_rails cluster::stop --only #{port} \
        -C #{RAILS_ROOT}/config/mongrel_cluster.yml"
      w.grace = 10 # seconds
      
      pid_file = File.join(RAILS_ROOT, "log/mongrel.#{port}.pid")
      
      w.behavior(:clean_pid_file) do |b|
        b.pid_file = pid_file
      end

      w.start_if do |start|
        start.condition(:process_running) do |c|
          c.interval = 5 # seconds
          c.running = false
          c.pid_file = pid_file
        end
      end
      
      w.restart_if do |restart|
        restart.condition(:memory_usage) do |c|
          c.pid_file = pid_file
          c.above = (150 * 1024) # 150mb
          c.times = [3, 5] # 3 out of 5 intervals
        end
      
        restart.condition(:cpu_usage) do |c|
          c.pid_file = pid_file
          c.above = 50 # percent
          c.times = 5
        end
      end
    end
  end
end
